# pymesatools
 
pymesatools is a python package that acts as an interface for the stellar evolution code [Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/). It interacts with MESA by manipulating inlists and running the star executable (and more!).

The package is still in development and there may be bugs and missing features.
